    "lyrics": "\nVerse 1\nO Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder\nConsider all the works Thy hands have made,\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,\nThy pow’r thru-out the universe displayed!\n\nChorus\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!\n\nVerse 2\nWhen thru the woods and forest glades I wander\nAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,\nWhen I look down from lofty mountain grandeur\nAnd hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze,\n\nChorus\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!\n\nVerse 3\nAnd when I think that God, His Son not sparing,\nSent Him to die, I scarce can take it in –\nThat on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,\nHe bled and died to take away my sin!\n\nChorus\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!\n\nVerse 4\nWhen Christ shall come with shout of acclamation\nAnd take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!\nThen I shall bow in humble adoration\nAnd there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!\n\nChorus\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!\nThen sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee;\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!"
